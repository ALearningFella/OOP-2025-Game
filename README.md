# Strategy-8

Our game will be a simple Turn-Based Strategy Game, loosely taking inspiration from 4
main games: Civilization, Total War: Warhammer, Risk, Age of Empires. At its core, it is a
simple resource gathering and battling strategy game, with map conquering elements. Its
map style is inspired by Civilization, and the art follows a simple pixel style top-down
style.

# Repository organization
We were given a strict template to be followed which can be seen in the files here.

# Project Implementation 
We used the default git workflow, used branches and frequent commits (and of course lots of merge conflict fixing :D)
Everyone had their own respective branch to work on, and at the end we had to give a
demo fully working and able to be run just using the setup readme.

# Working practices
We mostly communicated through telegram and decided on how we do things there.

**The group was meeting weekly**

The weekly meetings and reports can be seen in their respective folder.

# TODOs
Project TODOs were tracked with GitLab issues.
